## Measurements

Measurements on the water stations can be 1 of the ones below:

| Measurement      | Units    | Sensor                        |
| :-:              | :-:      | :-:                           |
| Temperature      | ÂºC       | Atlas PT-1000, PT-100 probes  |
| pH               | -        | Atlas pH probes               |
| Conductivity     | uS/cm    | Atlas Conductivity probes     |
| Dissolved Oxygen | mg/l     | Atlas DO probes               |
| ORP              | mV       | Atlas ORP probes              |

In the image at the top of the page you can see an example of a One-Sensor Water Station that measures pH, and below you can see another that measures temperature.
