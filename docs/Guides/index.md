# A modular tool for citizen action

These guides will help you get started with your projects during **MINKE**. We will complete this section with tools and resources around the sensor. Find here guides that will help with making the best use of the sensors, from a step-by-step guide on how to [set up your kit](/Guides/getting started/Onboarding Sensors) to more advanced features like [data analysis](https://pypi.org/project/scdata) or using the [SCK's shell](/Guides/getting started/Using the Shell).
