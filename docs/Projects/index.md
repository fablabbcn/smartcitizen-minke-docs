# Projects

This section will host the results and discussions around the different projects during the MINKE project [Open Calls](https://minke.eu/services/apply-for-tna-va/) with Low Cost sensors.

If you are part of a project in the Open calls, you will have free access to sensors and the team's support for your projects. The only thing we ask in return is to make sure to follow our [demo project template](demo) so that others can see what you are doing with the sensors, and to remember to use the forum to discuss about your project and interact with the community!
