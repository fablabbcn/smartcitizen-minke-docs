The MINKE sensor portfolio is a selection of sensors from the [Smart Citizen project](https://docs.smartcitizen.me), and aims to **create a boilerplate for individuals and communities with different sensing expertise levels in a modular, expandable and intuitive way**. We have made a selection of sensors to get started with the most common use cases.

## Sensor packs

- [Citizen Kit](/Sensors/Citizen Kit): for those cases where a low cost sensor is needed for basic monitoring of climate metrics, or some basic air pollution setups
- [Citizen Air Station](/Sensors/Citizen Air Station): a more advance air quality measurement unit that can characterise pollution profiles.
- [Citizen Water Station](/Sensors/Citizen Water Station): a flexible solution for water monitoring. 

!!! info "Take a deeper look"
    We also include GPS readings in some of the sensors, to be able to measure dynamically like in the [Pati Cientific](https://paticientific.org/)

## How to get them?

If you are interested, and have an use case or project that needs of some sensors, support or maybe some enclosures, this is for you! We will be creating a series of [open calls](/about/open calls/).
