The MINKE sensor portfolio is a selection of sensors from the [Smart Citizen project](https://docs.smartcitizen.me), and aims to **create a boilerplate for individuals and communities with different sensing expertise levels in a modular, expandable and intuitive way**. We have made a selection of sensors to get started with the most common use cases.

!!! success "How to get them?"
    If you are interested, and have an use case or project that needs of some sensors, support or maybe some enclosures, this is for you! We will be creating a series of [open calls](https://minke.eu/services/apply-for-tna-va/).

- [Citizen Kit](/Sensors/Citizen Kit): for those cases where a low cost sensor is needed for basic monitoring of climate metrics, or some basic air pollution setups
- [Citizen Water Kit](/Sensors/Basic Water Station): a combination of water and air sensors, to choose between pH and ORP for water sensors, water temperature, and adding an air temperature and humidity
- [Citizen Water Station](/Sensors/Citizen Water Station): a flexible solution for water monitoring. Includes metrics like pH, DO, Conductivity, ORP and submergible temperature, with optional GPS


| **Kit** | **Use** | **Available units** | **Metrics** | **Power** |
| :-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |
| **Citizen Kit** | Air quality | 60-90 |  T, H, P, PM, Noise, Light and VOCs | USB or AC with Power supply |
| **Basic Water Station** | Air/Water | 40-50 |  Air T, H; Water pH, ORP or T  | USB or AC with Power supply |
| **Advanced Water Station** | Water | 16 |  Water pH, ORP, DO, COND, T and optional GPS | USB or AC with Power supply |

!!! info "Looking for mobile measurements?"
    We also include GPS readings in some of the sensors, to be able to measure dynamically like in the [Pati Cientific](https://paticientific.org/)
